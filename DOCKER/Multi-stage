# Multi-stage build reduce the final image size.
# It only keeps required files in the final image.

# First stage: Cloning the repository (Not included in image)
# --------------
FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS builder
RUN apt update && apt install -y git
RUN git clone https://github.com/pandacloud1/webapp3.git /app

# Second stage: Apache server (Final image)
# --------------
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt update && apt install -y apache2
COPY --from=builder /app /var/www/html
CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
EXPOSE 80

# Note
# The git package & Github repo additional data is not copied in the final image
# Hence, the image size will get reduced

============================================
# Use below for more reduced image
# Alpine (~5MB) is much small as compared to Ubuntu (~30MB)

# First stage: Cloning the repository (using Alpine)
FROM alpine:latest AS builder
RUN apk add --no-cache git
RUN git clone https://github.com/pandacloud1/webapp3.git /app

# Second stage: Apache server (Final lightweight image)
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache apache2
COPY --from=builder /app /var/www/html
CMD ["httpd", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
EXPOSE 80
